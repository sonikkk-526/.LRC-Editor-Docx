  <h1>Note</h1>
  <p>
    This feature includes multiple different user-input validations (which means that the program checks your input to see if it matches its expectations).
    Therefore, it may pop up different error messages in the output panel, no need to worry as they are pretty self-explanatory.<br>
  </p>

  <p>However, you can still reach to the Side Note page for details explainations if you are still confused :)</p>
	<p>Corresponding (sub)page will show the details of each feature. Go ahead and explore!</p>
