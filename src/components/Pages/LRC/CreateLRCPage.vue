  <h1>Creating your .LRC Files</h1>
  <p>
    There are different ways to create a .LRC files, one of the most easiest way to think of is to use your ears.
    However, I am here to share two different ways other than using your ears:
  </p>

  <p><b><u>1.</u> "Download YouTube video caption": </b>YouTube captions use .SRT files, you can actually download it and convert it to .LRC -</p>
  <p>
    Here are the tools that I used:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Download YouTube video captions > https://downsub.com/ <br></li>
      <li>Convert .SRT to .LRC > https://toolslick.com/conversion/subtitle/srt-to-lrc</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <i>Per last time I checked, it seems not to violate any copyright or user agreement <u>iff</u> you only download the video's caption.</i>


  <p><b><u>2.</u> "Download from online":</b> Google is your best friend when searching for resources-</p>
  <p>
    There are different "forum" (ie. lyricsify, megalobiz, or
    <a href="https://github.com/sonikkk-526/lrc-lyrics-library" target="_blank">my lrc-lyrics-library</a>)
    where you can download your .LRC files from.
