1. @exit small menu on click (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRO-zM7_vb4&t=183s&ab_channel=cdruc)

2. small menu overlapped ✅

3. consider using v-model or v-bind for images

4. scoped import css also affected FAQ pages
    - after loading featureview, then it affects global css

5. small menu needs more left location, as margin is setted to zero ✅

download: 
ok. this is the most important thing I would like to bring up, but due to the limitation of the markdown file I used before, its hard to achieve.

for current version, I will only post a video about how to either
 (1) download from web and;
 (2) download from youtube.

_in future update_, I will implement download from youtube feature
(last time I checked does not appear to violate any copyright issue as long as I am only offering a download caption service only).
