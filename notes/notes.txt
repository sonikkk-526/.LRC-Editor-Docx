<----------------Work----------------->
To-fix list:
1. scoped import css also affected FAQ pages 
    - after loading featureview, then it affects global css

2a. Close label child baseed on latest children state*

2b. Split label and dropdown into two buttons
    - such that the page could change while not having the child state change.

3. content-container could reference blog style, center.
    - padding left and right, while setting the min-width.

4. Dark mode if possible

To-do list:
1. index page should breif #about this program, #install and uninstall instructions, #licensing.
    - feature/gettingstart should remove badges.

*2. "Lyrics Editor feature page" content should belong to index.

<-----------------Page Descriptionn Notes---------------->
download page notes:
ok. this is the most important thing I would like to bring up, but due to the limitation of the markdown file I used before, its hard to achieve.

create LRC methods:
 (1) download from web (ie. lyricsify, megalobiz, lrc-database)
 (2) download from youtube.

_in future update_, I will implement download from youtube feature
(last time I checked does not appear to violate any copyright issue as long as I am only offering a download caption service only).

need to reach out to more people about this program

<----------------Completed----------------->
1. small menu overlapped ✅

2. consider using v-model or v-bind for images ✅

3. small menu needs more left location, as margin is setted to zero ✅
